# Terminal Roguelike Engine

## Preamble
This project is a port of a project I worked on for the first half of 2022, that I wrote to learn C#. With that goal complete, I figured I'd go and port it into C++, as a refresher, and also simply because it's the language I'm most comfortable with. Over time, I hope this project will become something unique and usable as an actual engine of sorts.

## Description
A roguelike engine that runs in a terminal window, using Unicode text instead of pixels for display.
Currently somewhat feature-bare. There is a half working UI system, and, though it's turned off for the moment, a grid-based world with movement and a "camera".
